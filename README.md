#Odette.js
A fully featured set of tools to get your scripts and pipelines up, running, tested, and finished quickly. By decoupling views from models, like backbone, js based directives, and the ability to handle multiple versions as well as multiple windows, Odette is the only framework that makes sense to use in today's integrated web landscape. Odette empowers you to monotize your content by creating your own framework and carving out space for anyone to fill, all while letting you elegantly manage your own site, events, and data in a single, unified way. When everyone is on the same page, the whole web can move forward together. Odette has learned from many other ways of thinking, and eventually, came up with her own.
